# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Thabiso Owen Machipi, an Astrophysicist, Data Scientist, and Data Analyst with a Master of Science in Astrophysical Science from North-West University and a Bachelor of Science Honours in Physics. This portfolio highlights my journey through academia and my work in data science and astrophysical research.

I specialize in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization. With expertise in Python, R, and SQL, I am skilled in using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Matplotlib to extract insights and create interactive dashboards. I also work with data manipulation libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, and I’ve applied machine learning techniques through Scikit-learn.

This portfolio showcases projects like Supernova Remnants Data Analysis, where I investigated magnetic field dynamics, and Customer Churn Prediction, a machine learning model developed to identify at-risk customers. Additionally, I created a Sales Dashboard to visualize business data trends and enhance decision-making.

Beyond technical skills, I have hands-on experience as a Lab Assistant, Physics Tutor, and Marketing Analyst, where I’ve developed strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and grow professionally.

Feel free to explore my projects, connect with me, and reach out for collaborations or professional opportunities. Let’s create something amazing together!
